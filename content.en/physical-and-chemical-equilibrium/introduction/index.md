## 8.1 Introduction

our daily life, we observe several chemical and changes. For example, a banana gets ripened days, silver gets tarnished in few months gets rusted slowly. These processes proceed rection. Now let us consider the transport of y hemoglobin in our body as an illustration ersible change. The hemoglobin combines en in lungs to form oxyhemoglobin. The oxy-

bin has a tendency to form hemoglobin by

releasing oxygen. In fact, in our lungs all the three species coexist.

Few chemical reactions proceed in only one direction whereas many reactions proceed in both the directions and these reactions are called reversible reactions.

In chemical reactions, the concentration of the reactants decreases and that of the products increases with time. In reversible reactions, initially the reaction proceeds towards the formation of the product. Upon formation of the product, the reverse reaction begins to take place. At a particular stage, the rate of the reverse reaction is equal to that of the forward reaction indicating a state of equilibrium.

It is desirable to know the three crucial aspects of chemical reactions namely the feasibility, the rate of the reaction and the extent of reaction. We know that the feasibility of a reaction is given by thermodynamics. Chemical kinetics will tell about the rate of the reaction. The equilibrium constant tells about the extent of a reaction which we will discuss in this chapter. We will also discuss the types of equilibrium, the significance of equilibrium constant and its relationship to thermodynamic quantities and the response of chemical equilibrium to change in the reaction conditions.
