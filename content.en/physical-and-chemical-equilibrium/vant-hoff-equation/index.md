## 8.9 Van't Hoff Equation

This equation gives the quantitative temperature dependence of equilibrium constant (K). The relation between standard free energy change (ΔG°) and equilibrium constant is

ΔG° = –RTln K (1)

We know that

ΔG° = ΔH° – TΔS° (2)

Substituting (1) in equation (2)

–RTln K = ΔH° – TΔS°

There are different types of equilibrium.

Physical equilibrium

Chemical Equilibrium

• Chemical reactions which are reversible do not cease, when equilibrium is attained. At equilibrium the forward and the backward reactions are proceeding at the same rate and no macroscopic change is observed. So chemical equilibrium is in a state of dynamic equilibrium.

• The rate law states that, “At any instant, the rate of a chemical reaction at a given temperature is directly proportional to the product of the active masses of the reactants at that instant”.

• The value of equilibrium constant, Kc tells us the extent of a reaction, i.e., it indicates how far the reaction has proceeded towards product formation at a given temperature.

• Under non-equilibrium conditions, reaction quotient ‘Q’ is defined as the ratio of the product of active masses of reaction products raised to the respective stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced chemical equation to that of the reactants.
