**10.4 Coordinate covalent bond**

In the formation of a covalent bond, both the combining atoms contribute one electron each and these electrons are mutually shared among them. However, in certain bond formation, one of the combining atoms donates a pair of electrons i.e. two electrons which are necessary for the covalent bond formation, and these electrons are shared by both the combining atoms. These type of bonds are called coordinate  

covalent bond or coordinate bond. The combining atom which donates the pair of electron is called a donor atom and the other atom an acceptor atom. This bond is denoted by an arrow starting from the donor atom pointing towards the acceptor atom. (Later in coordination compound, we will refer the donor atom as ligand and the acceptor atom as central-metal atom/ion.

For Example, in ferrocyanide ion \[Fe(CN)6\]

4–, each cyanide ion (CN–) donates a pair of electrons to form a coordinate bond with iron (Fe2+) and these electrons are shared by Fe 2+ and CN - .

**10.5 Bond parameters**

A covalent bond is characterised by parameters such as bond length, bond angle, bond order etc... A brief description of some of the bond parameters is given below.

**10.5.1 Bond length**

The distance between the nuclei of the two covalently bonded atoms is called bond length. Consider a covalent molecule A-B. The bond length is given by the sum of the radii of the bonded atoms (rA + rB). The length of a bond can be determined by spectroscopic, x-ray diffraction and electron-diffraction techniques The bond length depends on the size of the atom and the number of bonds (multiplicity) between the combining atoms.

Bond length

**Fig 10. 13 Bond length of covalent molecule A–B**

Greater the size of the atom, greater will be the bond length. For example, carbon-carbon single bond length (1.54 Å) is longer than the carbon-nitrogen single bond length (1.43 Å).

Increase in the number of bonds between the two atoms decreases the bond  

length. For example, the carbon-carbon single bond is longer than the carbon- carbon double bond (1.33 Å) and the carbon-carbon triple bond (1.20 Å).

**10.5.2 Bond order**

The number of bonds formed between the two bonded atoms in a molecule is called the bond order. In Lewis theory, the bond order is equal to the number of shared pair of electrons between the two bonded atoms. For example in hydrogen molecules, there is only one shared pair of electrons and hence, the bond order is one. Similarly, in H2O, HCl, Methane, etc the central atom forms single bonds with bond order of one.

**10.5.3 Bond angle**

Covalent bonds are directional in nature and are oriented in specific directions in space. This directional nature creates a fixed angle between two covalent bonds in a molecule and this angle is termed as bond angle. It is usually expressed in degrees. The bond angle can be determined by spectroscopic methods and it can give some idea about the shape of the molecule.

**10.5.4 Bond enthalpy**

The bond enthalpy is defined as the minimum amount of energy required to break one mole of a particular bond in molecules in their gaseous state. The unit of bond enthalpy is kJ mol-1. Larger the bond enthalpy, stronger will be the bond. The bond energy value depends on the size of the atoms and the number of bonds between the bonded atoms. Larger the size of the atom involved in the bond, lesser is the bond enthalpy.

In case of polyatomic molecules with, two or more same bond types, in the term average bond enthalpy is used. For such  

bonds, the arithmetic mean of the bond energy values of the same type of bonds is considered as average bond enthalpy. For example in water, there are two OH bonds present and the energy needed to break them are not same. H2O(g)→H(g)+OH(g) ΔH1 = 502 kJ mol-1

OH(g)→H(g)+O(g) ΔH2 = 427 kJ mol-1

The average bond enthalpy of OH

bond in water = 502+427 2

**10.5.5 Resonance**

When we write Lewis structures for a molecule, more than one valid Lewis structures are possible in certain cases. For example let us consider the Lewis structure of carbonate ion \[CO3\]

In this case, we can draw two additional Lewis structures by moving the lone pairs from the other two oxygens  

(OB and OC) thus creating three similar structures as shown below in which the relative position of the atoms are same. They only differ in the position of bonding and lone pair of electrons. Such structures are called resonance structures (canonical structures) and this phenomenon is called resonance.

It is evident from the experimental results that all carbon-oxygen bonds in carbonate ion are equivalent. The actual structure of the molecules is said to be the resonance hybrid, an average of these three resonance forms. It is important to note that carbonate ion does not change from one structure to another and vice versa. It is not possible to picturise the resonance hybrid by drawing a single Lewis structure. However, the following structure gives a qualitative idea about the correct structure.

**10.5.6 Polarity of Bonds**

**Partial ionic character in covalent bond:**

When a covalent bond is formed between two identical atoms (as in the case of H2, O2, Cl2 etc...) both atoms have equal tendency to attract the shared pair of electrons and hence the shared pair of electrons lies exactly in the middle of the nuclei of two atoms. However, in the case of covalent bond formed between atoms having different electronegativities, the atom with higher electronegativity will have greater tendency to attract the shared pair of electrons more towards itself than the other atom. As a result the cloud of shared electron pair gets distorted.

Let us consider the covalent bond between hydrogen and fluorine in hydrogen  

fluoride. The electronegativities of hydrogen and fluorine on Pauling's scale are 2.1 and 4 respectively. It means that fluorine attracts the shared pair of electrons approximately twice as much as the hydrogen which leads to partial negative charge on fluorine and partial positive charge on hydrogen. Hence, the H-F bond is said to be polar covalent bond.

Here, a very small, equal and opposite charges are separated by a small distance (91 pm) and is referred to as a dipole.

**Dipole moment:**

The polarity of a covalent bond can be measured in terms of dipole moment which is defined as

μ = q × 2d

Where μ is the dipole moment, q is the charge and 2d is the distance between the two charges. The dipole moment is a vector and the direction of the dipole moment vector points from the negative charge to positive charge.

**+**q **\-**q 2d μ

**Fig 10. 15 Representation of Dipole**

The unit for dipole moment is columb meter (C m). It is usually expressed in Debye unit (D). The conversion factor is 1 Debye = 3.336 x 10 -30 C m

Diatomic molecules such as H2, O2, F2 etc... have zero dipole moment and are called non polar molecules and molecules such as HF, HCl, CO, NO etc... have non zero dipole moments and are called polar molecules.




  

Molecules having polar bonds will not necessarily have a dipole moment. For example, the linear form of carbon dioxide has zero dipole moment, even though it has two polar bonds. In CO2, the dipole moments of two polar bonds (CO) are equal in magnitude but have opposite direction. Hence, the net dipole moment of the CO2 is, μ = μ1 + μ2 = μ1 + (-μ1) = 0

O== C == O

In this case μ= μ1 + μ2

The extent of ionic character in a covalent bond can be related to the electro negativity difference to the bonded atoms. In a typical polar molecule, Aδ--Bδ+, the electronegativity difference (χA- χB) can be used to predict the percentage of ionic character as follows.

If the electronegativity difference (χA- χB ), is

equal to 1.7, then the bond A-B has 50% ionic character

if it is greater than 1.7, then the bond A-B has more than 50% ionic character,

and if it is lesser than 1.7, then the bond A-B has less than 50% ionic character.

**Partial covalent character in ionic bonds:** Like the partial ionic character in covalent compounds, ionic compounds show partial covalent character. For example, the ionic compound, lithium chloride shows covalent character and is soluble in organic solvents such as ethanol.

The partial covalent character in ionic compounds can be explained on the basis of a phenomenon called polarisation. We know that in an ionic compound, there is an electrostatic attractive force between the cation and anion. The positively charged cation attracts the valence electrons of anion while repelling the nucleus. This causes a distortion in the electron cloud of the anion and its electron density drifts towards the cation, which results in some sharing of the

valence electrons between these ions. Thus, a partial covalent character is developed between them. This phenomenon is called polarisation.

The ability of a cation to polarise an anion is called its polarising ability and the tendency of an anion to get polarised is called its polarisability. The extent of polarisation in an ionic compound is given by the Fajans rules

**Fajans Rules** (i) To show greater covalent character, both

the cation and anion should have high charge on them. Higher the positive charge on the cation, greater will be the attraction on the electron cloud of the anion. Similarly higher the magnitude of negative charge on the anion, greater is its polarisability. Hence, the increase in charge on cation or in anion increases the covalent character

Let us consider three ionic compounds aluminum chloride, magnesium chloride and sodium chloride. Since the charge of the cation increase in the order Na+ < Mg2+ < Al3+, the covalent character also follows the same order NaCl < MgCl2 < AlCl3.

(ii) The smaller cation and larger anion show greater covalent character due to the greater extent of polarisation.

Lithium chloride is more covalent than sodium chloride. The size of Li+ is smaller than Na+ and hence the polarising power of Li+ is more. Lithium iodide is more covalent than lithium chloride as the size of I- is larger than the Cl- . Hence I- will be more polarised than Cl- by the cation, Li+ .  

(iii) Cations having ns2 np6 nd10 configuration show greater polarising power than the cations with ns2 np6 configuration. Hence, they show greater covalent character.

CuCl is more covalent than NaCl. Compared to Na+ (1.13 Å) . Cu+ (0.6 Å) is small and have 3s2 3p6 3d10 configuration.

**10.6 Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory** Lewis concept of structure of molecules deals with the relative position of atoms in the molecules and sharing of electron pairs between them. However, we cannot predict the shape of the molecule using Lewis concept. Lewis theory in combination with VSEPR theory will be useful in predicting the shape of molecules.

**Important principles of VSEPR Theory are as follows:**

1\. The shape of the molecules depends on the number of valence shell electron pair around the central atom.

2\. There are two types of electron pairs namely bond pairs and lone pairs. The bond pair of electrons are those shared between two atoms, while the lone pairs are the valence electron pairs that are not involved in bonding.

3\. Each pair of valence electrons around the central atom repels each other and hence, they are located as far away as possible in three dimensional space to minimize the repulsion between them.




  

4\. The repulsive interaction between the differ order.

**The lone pair of electrons are localised on** one nucleus whereas the bond pairs are shared b nuclei. Because of this the lone pairs occupy mo the bond pairs in a molecule.

**10.10 Molecular orbital theory**

Lewis concept and valence bond theory qualitatively explains the chemical bonding and molecular structure. Both approaches are inadequate to describe some of the observed properties of molecules. For example, these theories predict that oxygen is diamagnetic. However, it was observed that oxygen in liquid form was attracted towards the poles of strong magnet, indicating that oxygen is paramagnetic. As both these theories treated the bond formation in terms of electron pairs and hence they fail to explain the bonding nature of paramagnetic molecules. F. Hund and Robert. S. Mulliken developed a bonding theory called molecular orbital theory which explains the magnetic behaviour of molecules.

**The salient features of Molecular orbital Theory (MOT):**

1\. When atoms combines to form molecules, their individual atomic orbitals lose their identity and forms new orbitals called molecular orbitals.

2\. The shapes of molecular orbitals depend upon the shapes of combining atomic orbitals.  

3\. The number of molecular orbitals formed is the same as the number of combining atomic orbitals. Half the number of molecular orbitals formed will have lower energy than the corresponding atomic orbital, while the remaining molecular orbitals will have higher energy. The molecular orbital with lower energy is called bonding molecular orbital and the one with higher energy is called anti-bonding molecular orbital. The bonding molecular orbitals are represented as σ (Sigma), π (pi), δ (delta) and the corresponding antibonding orbitals are denoted as σ\*, π\* and δ\*.

4\. The electrons in a molecule are accommodated in the newly formed molecular orbitals. The filling of electrons in these orbitals follows Aufbau's principle, Pauli's exclusion principle and Hund's rule as in the case of filling of electrons in atomic orbitals.

5\. Bond order gives the number of covalent bonds between the two combining atoms. The bond order of a molecule can be calculated using the following equation

Bond order Nb

Ν =

− a

2

Where,

Nb = Total number of electrons present in the bonding molecular orbitals

Na = Total number of electrons present in the antibonding molecular orbitals and

A bond order of zero value indicates that the molecule doesn't exist.




  

**10.10.1 Linear combination of atomic orbitals**

The wave functions for the molecular orbitals can be obtained by solving Schrödinger wave equation for the molecule. Since solving the Schrödinger equation is too complex, approximation methods are used to obtain the wave function for molecular orbitals. The most common method is the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO).

We know that the atomic orbitals are represented by the wave function Ψ. Let us consider two atomic orbitals represented by the wave function ψA and ψB with comparable energy, combines to form two molecular orbitals. One is bonding molecular orbital(ψbonding) and the other is antibonding molecular orbital(ψantibonding). The wave functions for these two molecular orbitals can be obtained by the linear combination of the atomic orbitals ψA and ψB as below.

ψbonding = ψA + ψB

ψantibonding = ψA - ψB

The formation of bonding molecular orbital can be considered as the result of constructive interference of the atomic orbitals and the formation of anti-bonding molecular orbital can be the result of the destructive interference of the atomic orbitals. The formation of the two molecular orbitals from two 1s orbitals is shown below.

**Metallic bonding**

Metals have some special properties of lustre, high density, high electrical and thermal conductivity, malleability and ductility, and high melting and boiling points. The forces that keep the atoms of the metal so closely in a metallic crystal constitute what is generally known as the metallic bond. The metallic bond is not just an electrovalent bond(ionic bond), as the latter is formed between atoms of different electro negativities. Similarly, the metallic bond is not a covalent bond,as the metal atoms do not have sufficient number of valence electrons for mutual sharing with 8 or 12 neighboring metal atoms in a crystal. So, we have to search for a new theory to explain metallic bond. The first successful theory is due to Drude and Lorentz, which regards metallic crystal as an assemblage of positive ions immersed in a gas of free electrons. The free electrons are due to ionization of the valence electrons of the atoms of the metal. As the valence electrons of the atoms are freely shared by all the ions in the crystal, the metallic bonding is also referred to as electronic bonding. As the free electrons repel each other, they are uniformly distributed around the metal ions. Many physical properties of the metals can be explained by this theory, nevertheless there are exceptions.

The electrostatic attraction between the metal ions and the free electrons yields a three-dimensional close packed crystal with a large number of nearest metal ions. So, metals have high density. As the close packed structure contains many slip planes along which movement can occur during mechanical loading, the metal acquires  

ductility. Pure metals can undergo 40 to 60% elongation prior to rupturing under mechanical loading. As each metal ion is surrounded by electron cloud in all directions, the metallic bonding has no directional properties.

As the electrons are free to move around the positive ions, the metals exhibit high electrical and thermal conductivity. The metallic luster is due to reflection of light by the electron cloud. As the metallic bond is strong enough, the metal atoms are reluctant to break apart into a liquid or gas, so the metals have high melting and boiling points.

The bonding in metal is better treated by Molecular orbital theory. As per this theory, the atomic orbitals of large number of atoms in a crystal overlap to form numerous bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals without any band gap. The bonding molecular orbitals are completely filled with an electron pair in each, and the antibonding molecular orbitals are empty. Absence of band gap accounts for high electrical conductivity of metals. High thermal conductivity is due to thermal excitation of many electrons from the valence band to the conductance band. With an increase in temperature, the electrical conductivity decreases due to vigorous thermal motion of lattice ions that disrupts the uniform lattice structure, that is required for free motion of electrons within the crystal. Most metals are black except copper, silver and gold. It is due to absorption of light of all wavelengths. Absorption of light of all wavelengths is due to absence of bandgap in metals.




  

**SUMMARY**

In molecules, atoms are held together by attractive forces, called chemical bonds. Kossel and Lewis are the first people to provide a logical explanation for chemical bonding. They proposed that atoms try to attain the nearest noble gas electronic configuration by losing, gaining or sharing one or more electrons during the bond formation. The noble gases contain eight electrons in their valance shell which is considered to be stable electronic configuration. The idea of Kossel – Lewis approach to chemical bond lead to the octet rule, which states that “the atoms transfer or share electrons so that all atoms involved in chemical bonding obtain 8 electrons in their outer shell (valance shell)”.

There are different types of chemical bonds. In compounds such as sodium chloride, the sodium atom loses an electron which is accepted by the chlorine atom resulting in the formation of Na+ and Cl- ions. These two ions are held together by the electrostatic attractive forces. This type of chemical bond is known as ionic bonds or electrovalent bonds. In certain compounds, instead of the complete transfer of electrons, the electrons are shared by both the bonding atoms. The two combining atoms are held together by their mutual attraction towards the shared electrons. This type of bond is called covalent bonding. In addition, there also another bond type known as coordinate covalent bonds, where the shared electrons of a covalent bond are provided by only one of the combining atoms. Metallic bonding is another type of bonding which is observed in metals.  

Lewis theory in combination with VSEPR theory will be useful in predicting the shape of molecules. According to this theory, the shape of the molecules depends on the number of valance shell electron pair (lone pairs and bond pairs) around the central atom. Each pair of valance electrons around the central atom repels each other and hence, they are located as far away as possible in three-dimensional space to minimise the repulsion between them.

Heitler and London gave a theoretical treatment to explain the formation of covalent bond in hydrogen molecule on the basis of wave mechanics of electrons. It was further developed by Pauling and Slater. According to this theory when half-filled orbitals of two atoms overlap, a covalent bond will be formed between them. Linus Pauling introduced the concept of hybridisation. Hybridisation is the process of mixing of atomic orbitals of the same atom with comparable energy to form equal number of new equivalent orbitals with same energy. There are different types of hybridization such as sp, sp2, sp3, sp3d2 etc..

F. Hund and Robert. S. Mulliken developed a bonding theory called molecular orbital theory. According to this theory, when atoms combines to form molecules, their individual atomic orbitals lose their identity and forms new orbitals called molecular orbitals. The filling of electrons in these orbitals follows Aufbau's principle, Pauli's exclusion principle and Hund's rule as in the case of filling of electrons in atomic orbitals.
