**10.8 Orbita**

When atoms combines to form a covalent atoms overlap to form a covalent bond. The bon region of the orbitals. Depending upon the n bonding between the two atoms as sigma (σ) an

**10.8.1 Sigma and Pi bonds**

When two atomic orbitals overlap linear a sigma (σ) bond. This overlap is also called involves an s orbital (s-s and s-p overlaps) will is spherical. Overlap between two p orbitals alo bond formation. When we consider x-axis as m σ-bond.

When two atomic orbitals overlaps sidew (π)bond. When we consider x-axis as molecular the formation of a π-bond.

Following examples will be useful to understand

**10.8.2 Formation of hydrogen (H2) Molecule**

Electronic configuration of hydrogen atom is 1s

During the formation of H2 molecule, the one unpaired electron with opposite spin overla This overlap is called s-s overlap. Such axial ov bond.

Valence shell electronic configuration of fluorine atom : 2s<sup>2</sup> 2p<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup>, 2p<sub>y</sub><sup>2</sup>, 2p<sub>z</sub><sup>1</sup>
When half filled 1s orbital of hydrogen linearly overlaps with a half filled 2p<sub>z</sub>orbital of fluorine,
a σ-covalent bond is formed between hydrogen and fluorine.

When the half filled p<sub>z</sub> orbitals of two oxygen overlaps along the z-axis (considering
molecular axis as z axis), a σ-covalent bond is formed between them. Other two half filled py
orbitals of two oxygen atoms overlap laterally (sideways) to form a π-covalent bond between the oxygen atoms. Thus, in oxygen molecule, two oxygen atoms are connected by two covalent
bonds (double bond). The other two pair of electrons present in the 2s and 2p<sub>x</sub> orbital do not
involve in bonding and remains as lone pairs on the respective oxygen.
