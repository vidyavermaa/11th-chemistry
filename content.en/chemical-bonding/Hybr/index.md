**10.9 Hybridisation**

Bonding in simple molecules such as hy on the basis of overlap of the respective ato the observed properties of polyatomic molec chloride etc... cannot be explained on the ba example, it was experimentally proved that m four C-H bonds are equivalent. This fact can atomic orbitals of hydrogen (1s) and the atom (2s<sup>2</sup> 2p<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup>, 2p<sub>y</sub>, 2p<sub>z</sub>).

In order to explain these observed fac atomic orbitals in the molecules are different fr the concept of hybridisation. Hybridisation is the same atom with comparable energy to for with same energy. The resultant orbitals are maximum symmetry and definite orientatio repulsion between their electrons .

In BeCl2 both the Be-Cl bonds are equivalent and it was observed that the molecule is linear. VB theory explain this observed behaviour by sp hybridisation. One of the paired electrons in the 2s orbital gets excited to 2p orbital and the electronic configuration at the excited state is shown.

Now, the 2s and 2p orbitals hybridise and produce two equivalent sp hybridised orbitals which have 50 % s-character and 50 % p-character. These sp hybridised orbitals are oriented in opposite direction as shown in the figure.
