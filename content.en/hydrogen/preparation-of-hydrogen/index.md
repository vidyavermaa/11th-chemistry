**4.2 Preparation of Hydrogen**

High purity hydrogen (>99.9%) is obtained by the electrolysis of water containing traces of acid or alkali or the electrolysis of an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide using a nickel anode and iron cathode. However, this process is not economical for large-scale production.

**At anode:**
{{< katex  >}}
2 \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O} + \frac{1}{2} \text{O}_2 + 2e^-
{{< /katex >}}


**At cathode:**
{{< katex  >}}
2 \text{H}_2\text{O} + 2e^- \rightarrow 2 \text{OH}^- + \text{H}_2
{{< /katex >}}



**Overall reaction:**
{{< katex  >}}
\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{H}_2 + \frac{1}{2} \text{O}_2
{{< /katex >}}


**4.2.1 Laboratory Preparation**

Hydrogen is conveniently prepared in the laboratory by the reaction of metals, such as zinc, iron, tin with dilute acid.

**4.2.2 Industrial Production**

In large-scale production, hydrogen is produced by steam-reforming of hydrocarbons. In this method, a hydrocarbon such as methane is mixed with steam and passed over a nickel catalyst in the range of 800-900 °C and 35 atm pressures.

\text{CH}_4 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{CO} + 3\text{H}_2

In another process, steam is passed over red-hot coke to produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The mixture of gases produced in this way is known as _water gas (CO+H2)_, also called syngas (Synthetic gas), used in the synthesis of organic compounds such as methanol and simple hydrocarbons.

**Conversion of Carbon monoxide in water gas to Carbon dioxide:**

The carbon monoxide of the water gas can be converted to carbon dioxide by mixing the gas mixture with more steam at 400°C and passing it over a shift converter containing iron/copper catalyst. This reaction is called the water-gas shift reaction.

\text{CO} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2

The CO₂ formed in the above process is absorbed in a solution of potassium carbonate.

\text{CO}_2 + \text{K}_2\text{CO}_3 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow 2 \text{KHCO}_3

 **4.2.3 Preparation of Deuterium**

**Electrolysis of heavy water:**

Normal water contains 1.6 x 10^-4 percentage of heavy water. The dissociation of protium water H₂O is more than heavy water D₂O. Therefore, when water is electrolyzed, hydrogen is liberated much faster than  D₂. The electrolysis is continued until the resulting solution becomes enriched in heavy water. Further electrolysis of the heavy water gives deuterium.

**4.2.4 Preparation of Tritium**

As explained earlier, tritium is present only in trace amounts. It can be artificially prepared by bombarding lithium with slow neutrons in a nuclear fission reactor. The nuclear transmutation reaction for this process is as follows.
